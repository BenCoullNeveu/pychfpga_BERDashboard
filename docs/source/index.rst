Welcome to pychfpga's documentation!
====================================

The ``pychfpga`` package is the Python framework that is used to operate the FPGA-based F-engine hardware, corner-turn and optional firmware-basd X-engine that is used for a number of big and small interferometer radio telescopes, including the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME).
