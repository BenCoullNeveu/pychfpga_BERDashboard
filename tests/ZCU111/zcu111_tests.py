        SPI Tests

            - IO Expander (including blinking user LEDs)
            - PCB Temperature sensor
            - ADC temperature sensors (2x)
            - ADC chips (2x) (read chip ID & silicon revision. Do a dummy write)
            - Test IOExpander reset
            - Test ADC SPI Reset

        PLL Tests

            - Check the presence and frequency of the 10 MHz reference clock from the Mezzanine
            - Program the ADC PLL to generate the following frequencies:

                - 1600 MHz

            - Check the ADC output clock frequency
            - Send SYNC signal
            - Check if ADC output clock stops on both ADCs
            - Program the MGT PLL to generate the following frequencies:

                - 156.25 MHz

            - Check the MGT PLL lock line status
            - Check the MGT output clock frequency

        The computer will ask if the USER LEDs are blinking.
