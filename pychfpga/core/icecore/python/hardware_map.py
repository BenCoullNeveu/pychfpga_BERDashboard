"""Hardware mapper.

This HardwareMapper actually returns a SQLAlchemy session object, which we've
extended slightly. Here is a sample session that creates a couple of new
hardware map entries:

    >>> sqc = SQUIDController(serial=123, type="MGNGSQC01")
    >>> mezz = DfmuxMezzanine(serial=234, type="MGMEZZ04", sqc=sqc)
    >>> d = Dfmux(serial=345, revision=1, mezz1=mezz)

We'll create an empty hardware map (instead of loading one, for now) and add
our elements to it:

    >>> hwm = HardwareMap()
    >>> hwm.add(d)

Since the iceboard object references the other two, we don't need to add them
explicitly.

You can now query a particular element in the hardware map:

    >>> ds = hwm.query(Dfmux)

You can ask them questions in bulk:

    >>> ds.get_frequency(...)
    (1.23e6, 2.34e6, 3.45e6)

Note that these calls were dispatched in parallel (multi-threaded), so this is
much faster than the equivalent Python code:

    >>> print [ d.get_frequency(...) for d in ds ]
    [1.23e6, 2.34e6, 3.45e6]

You can retrieve a single IceBoard, and interact with its properties
(including the structures it links with):

    >>> d = hwm.query(IceBoard).filter_by(serial=345).first()
    >>> print ib.get_frequency(...)
    1.23e6
    >>> m = ib.mezz1
    >>> print m.type
    U'MGMEZZ04'

...et cetera. Beneath the hood, the query language is provided by SQLAlchemy,
which allows rich queries and handles object mapping for us. It's slick, and
it's code we don't have to write or maintain.

TODO: Turn "echo" on when instantiating the HardwareMapper and see how many
SQL queries are generated -- lots. It is probably worth playing with
SQLAlchemy's "eager" options and ensuring there are indices on the right
columns.

        You would ordinarily retrieve a bunch of query results as
        follows (assuming "serial" is some property of the underlying
        object):

            >>> objects = hwm.query(ObjectClass)
            >>> for o in objects:
            ...     o.do_something()

        Since objects like "o" tend to be network resources, and calls
        like "o.do_something()" tend to be I/O-limited, we are
        interested in running this kind of function call in a
        multi-threaded context. We use green threads to avoid the
        overhead from threading -- which seems minimal, until we pile
        on the SQLAlchemy housekeeping that's required.

        This call allows you to do exactly that, as follows:

            >>> objects.do_something()

        It does so by trapping calls it doesn't recognize itself, and
        delegating them to each object in the Query results. It returns
        an array of results corresponding to each underlying object.
