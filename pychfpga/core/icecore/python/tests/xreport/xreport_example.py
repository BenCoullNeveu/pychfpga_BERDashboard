""" Example nosetest test suite that make use of the Xreport plugin features.

This is a standard nose test file, so you could run it normally with
``nosetests`` **if** the xreport plugin has been installed and registered::

   nosetests xreport_example --xfile test --xargs --iceboards 10.10.10.7   # Won't work unless you registered the plugin

An easier alternative is to run xreport module as a script, which will invoke nosetest but will automatically add the plugin::

   python xreport.py xreport_example --xfile test --xargs --iceboards 10.10.10.7   # Should work

This will save the test report as `test.xml`, which can be opened viewed directly by your web browser.
This will also save a reStructuredText report in 'test.rst', with 'test_image0.png' as an image referred by the document.
