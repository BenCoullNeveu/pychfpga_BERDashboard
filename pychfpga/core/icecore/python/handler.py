"""Handler management classes.

A Handler is a user-defined, persistent Python object that is dynamically
linked to a volatile object in order to extend its attributes and
methods. They are typically used to provide stateful methods linked to
SQLAlchemy ORM objects

Handlers behave as normal Python objects.  All their instance attributes will
persist until the object is no longer used, as opposed to ORM objects that
might have their non-database attributes erased as part of
the background operation of the ORM engine. This, for instance, allows the
handler to store hardware state information, opened sockets or other runtime-
specific information that should not live in the database.

Handlers instances are only created once, and are reattached to the
parent object if the handler link has been erased by the parent.

Multiple Handler classes can be registered to an ORM class, allowing the ORM
object to dynamically switch functionality. For example, different handlers
can be activated depending on what firmware has been loaded on the hardware
represented by the parent object.

This module exposes the following classes:

    - HandlerObject: is inherited by the parent object to which we want to
      associate a handler. The class ensures the handler is reconnected to the
      object, and forwards attribute accesses to the handler.

    - Handler: is inherited by the application-specific handler. The class
      registers the handler to the parent object, and provides means for the
      handler to grab information from the parent.

class HandlerObject(object):

    """Automatically create and persistently associate a python class (a
    handler) to a 'volatile' parent object and forwards attribute accesses to
    it.

    A handler instance is accessed through the property `handler`.

    When the `handler` property is accessed on a parent object instance,
    `HandlerObject` looks for an already existing handler instance in its *handler instance
    registry* using the key provided by the 'handler_id'
    property, which is provided by the parent class.

    If no handler instance is found for that key, `HandlerObject` will create a
    new handler instance. To do so, it looks into the `_handler_class_registry`
    dictionary (a class attribute) to select a handler class based on the
    'handler_name' instance attribute. If a matching handler class is found, a
    new handler instance is created and registered. Otherwise, an error is
    raised.

    The user can manually define the `_handler_class_registry` in the parent
    class to list the handler class(es) that are to be used . However, the
    `Handler` class (or to be precise, its meta-class)  can automatically
    register the handler class to the specified parent object class if a parent
    class is specified (see `Handler`).

    In addition to providing persistent handler instance access, `HandlerObject`
    also extends the namespace of the parent object with that of the handler.

    To do this, `HandlerObject` defines __getattr__ and __dir__ to give the parent object
    access to all of the handler's attributes. Setting an attribute always
    sets it in the parent object, so use obj.handler.x=value instead of
    obj.x=value to set the attribute x in the handler.

    To have a handler, the parent object needs to inherit from this class
    and provide:
        - 'handler_id' property that return a key that uniquely identify the
          handler instance. If not specified, the default 'handler_id' assumes
          the parent is a SQLAlchemy ORM object and will use the session ID and its primary keys as
          a unique instance id (which exist only once the object has been added
          to the database).

        - `_handler_class_registry` class attribute which lists all the classes that can be used
          to create handler instances. The Handler class will automatically
          populate this dictionary.

        - `handler_name` class or instance attribute to select which handler
          class to use in the `_handler_class_registry`. This can be dynamically
          changed. `handler_name` defaults to None, meaning that this object
          does not use a handler.
