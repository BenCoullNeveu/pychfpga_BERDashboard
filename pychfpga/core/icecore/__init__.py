"""Top-level packaging for 'icecore'.

Code using icecore should use top-level imports. For example:

    >>> from icecore import HardwareMap  # good!

...rather than relative imports:

    >>> from pydfmux.hardware_map import HardwareMap  # bad!

This allows __init__ to structure the package's API separately from Python
code, which means we can evolve it more freely.
