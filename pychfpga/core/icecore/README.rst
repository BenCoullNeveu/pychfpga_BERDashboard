Icecore Preview
============================

This folder contains preview code of the ICE software/firmware development framework.
framework.


Icecore provides:

   * Hardware map management of arrays of Iceboards, Icecrates, FMC mezzanines
   * Multithreaded dispatching of function calls and variable accesses across multiple resources in the system
   * Python API to control and monitor basic hardware functions
   * VHDL to provide the core functionalities in the FPGA, on which a project is built.
   * Implements basic system monitoring
   * Handles system logs and exceptions

Requirements
-----------------

The Python code runs on Python 2.7 and requires the following packages:
   * numpy
   * sqlalchemy ( the object-oriented high-level SQL database interface)
   * gevents (coperative, lightweight multi-threading)
   * yaml (PyYAML, to process text-based YAML hardware map files)
Usage
--------

The Icecore repository is to be used as a component of an application project and should not be modified unless you are an administrator of this repository.

The top-level directory structure of this repository is ::

	icecore/
	  |- c/          Contains the C sources do build the code running on the ARM processor on the IceBoard
	  |- docs/
	  |- opkg/
	  |- python/     Contains the Python code used to access the ICE hardware and firmware
     |- rtl/ VHDL   source code for the core FPGA firmware that allows the Python code to talk to the FPGA, including an example project
	  |- www/ Web    server pages, served by the ARM

The base IceCore code is kept in the '/icecore' subfolder of the application-specific project. The project directory should follow the same structure as the icecore directory.

Adding icecore to your project
--------------------------------------

Assuming you are using GIT to manage tour application repository, you can add icecore to your project by following the steps below:

1. Create a git remote that represent this repository. This is merely a convenience so you don't have to specify the whole path on every git subtree commands by using the standard *git remote* command:

   ``git remote add –f {remote_name} {repository_url}``

2. Add the Icecore repository as a subfolder of your project 'myproject/icecore' with the *git subtree add* command:

   ``git subtree add --prefix={path/to/subdir} {remote} [branch] --squash``

The --squash option is generally what you want since it will create a single commit for the full commit history of the remote repository - it avoid to somehow pollute your local commit history. For this to work, your project must not have uncommited changes, and '/path/to/subdir' must not exist.

Example::

$ git remote add -f icecore_remote  https://jfcliche@bitbucket.org/jfcliche/icecore-preview.git
$ git subtree add --prefix=my_project/icecore  icecore_remote  master --squash


Pulling changes from the remote repository
------------------------------------------------------
If you are informed of wonderful new features that have been added to icecore and you want to bring them into your project, you can get the changes with *git subtree pull*:

``git subtree pull --prefix={path/to/subdir} {remote} [branch] --squash``

Here again, --squash prevents the whole history of commits that led to the new Icecore features to pollute your own project history, but you can omit it if you think the commit comments will provide useful informations. So, for example::

$ git subtree pull --prefix=myproject/icecore icecore_remote master --squash
