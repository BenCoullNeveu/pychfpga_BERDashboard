Tuber object interface


JFC: November 2020

Experimental re-haul, deployed on CHIME on Nov 2020 (8 crates/ 128 boards).

This updated module can be seen as a PEP-like proposal for future Tuber standardization.

Changes:
    - Use next_asyncio to allow  loop.run_until_complete() to  operate in already existing loops. Now we can truly run an async function even if it was called from a sync one.
    - tie ClientSessions to the current loop, and make sure we use the right one. In an interactive context, we often use multiple loops, and running a query in a loop while the session is in another loop just crashes.

    - methods, not just properties are populated as instance attributes (as opposed to class attributes), to ensure we could connect to IceBoards with different firmware.
    - Methods and properties are applied to the instance all at once when tuber_get_meta is called. This is a small delay compared to the metadata access time. Having a gradually-populated instance makes the timing of the instance less predictable
    - __dir__ is now trivial. Does not try to rebuild the attribute list, which is hard to do correctly. We just ensure we call tuber_get_meta is the instnces  attributes have not been set
    - __getattr__ is also now trivial. Also just ensures _tuber_get_meta() is called as needed. Added infinite recursion protections to protect against subclass errors.
    - Moved Tuber towards an fundamentally async module, with sync support for compatibility, instead of the way around.
    - the instance is populated with async tuber methods. prefix and suffix can be added to the names. (e.g. Suffix _async is useful and recommended for mixed sync/async code)
    - instance can be populated with additional wrapped methods that can be called synchronously
    - almost completely eliminated usage of tworoutines. We created small run_async() and sync_wrap() functions to support running async code in a sync function. This allows explicit use of async functions. Eliminates the non-intuitive tworoutine syntax.
    - All web operations now live in TuberObject, not spread between COntext and TuberObject.
    - Context is an awaitable, i.e. we can get a list of result for each previous calls with ``results = await ctx``.
    - This being said, we don't use Context anymore. TuberObject is self-contained. Context makes use of TuberObject. TuberObject is a specialization that CHIME does not use.
    - Likewise, TuberCategory is another specialization not used by CHIME. It has not been updated to use the new TuberObject.

    - removed simplejson: slower than json in Python 3. We use  ujson for encoding, which is even faster.
    - We added a json cache. Not useful for small requests, so it is not used
      by default. For large requests with lots of data (i.e. sending 12 MBytes
      bitstreams in base64), the memory usage for large arrays is N*4/3
      bitstream size, where N is the size of the array. For CHIME (128 boards) , this means
      that 2 Gbytes of memory is used just for the bitstreams.
    - The json cache is enable by a context manager, which sets as contextvars.ContextVar() that is seen only by the current and downstream awaits, and not by other instance calls that may occur while the current call is in progress.
    - See https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2015/09/29/benchmark-python-json-libraries/

    - better atexit cleanup
    - patch current interpreter loop to allow ipython tab completion. Need to do this better. Why is the on-the-fly patch not working?
    - PEP-0257 recommends triple-double-quotes for docstrings

    icecore changes:

        - Separted base hardware classes from SQLAlchemy/Hardware map objects. CHIME uses static maps that do not require database functionalities. System configuration is handled and stored centrally in databases at the experiment level.
        - pychfpga implement hardware maps as python lists; SQUAlchemy is no
          longer used. List comprehensions make simpler queries in our
          application.
        - chFPGA application-specific functions do not rely on
          the ARM; it is memory-mapped and dumb, so there is a lot of smarts
          and state in the Python objects.  We eliminated the complex
          handler work-around that was needed to prevent SQLAlchemy from
          randomly and continuously corrupting these stateful objects.
        - Moved all additional features added in my version of icecore back into my application.

      2020-11-04 JFC: Proposed changes, to be discussed, and todo:

    - Make tuber_objname an attribute
    - use ujson for decoding, not just encoding. drop json.
    - Add timeouts
    - I could provide my own caching ujson-based encoder/decoder objects if we don't want caching as a base feature. Shuld be added as class attributes overriden by subclasses.
    - Need to check  Context with legacy apps. TuberCategory needs to be debugged or removed if not a core feature.

class Context():
    """A context container for TuberCalls. Permits calls to be aggregated.

    Using this interface, you can write code like:

        #>>> from pydfmux import Dfmux, macro, asynchronously, Return

        #>>> @pydfmux.macro(Dfmux)
        #... def my_macro(d):
        #...     with d.tuber_context() as ctx:
        #...         p = ctx.get_mezzanine_power(2)
        #...         f = yield ctx.get_frequency(ctx.UNITS.HZ, 1, 1, 1)
        #...         ctx.set_frequency(f+1, ctx.UNITS.HZ, 1, 1, 1)
        #...         yield asynchronously(ctx)
        #...     raise Return((yield p))

        #>>> my_macro(d)
        #True

    Commands are dispatched to the board strictly in-order, but are
    automatically bundled up to reduce traffic. In this example, the first two
    calls are dispatched together, since the result 'p' is not used until
    later.

    There are a couple of important considerations:

        * Calls made on 'ctx' return Futures, which can be converted into
          their results via 'yield'.

        * The final 'yield asynchronously(ctx)' ensures the context queue is
          flushed. It's only necessary if you don't yield the results of the
          final call in the context. If you need this yield and leave it out,
          you'll see a warning and your code will dispatch synchronously (i.e.
          other work in the asynchronous framework won't get done in the
          meantime.)

    Note that you will *not* catch exceptions unless you check for them
    explicitly. For example, in this code:

        #>>> with d.tuber_context() as ctx:
        #...     p = ctx.get_mezzanine_power(3)

    the function call is executed, and generates an exception. The exception is
    embedded in 'p' and will not be raised unless you call 'p.result()'!

    Adjust the `connect_timeout` and `request_timeout` attributes of the ctx
    object to change the connect and request timeouts. The default value
    (1800 seconds) allows calls to the board to be quite slow.

class TuberCategory:
    """Pull Tuber functions into ORM objects based on categories.

    Here's an example. If "ib" is an IceBoard object, and you have the
    ordinary IceBoard function set_mezzanine_power(), you can run the
    following:

        >>> ib.set_mezzanine_power(True, 1)

    You also have the following ORM object:

        >>> m = ib.mezz1
        >>> print m.mezz_number
        1

    Rather than accessing mezzanine methods through the IceBoard, it
    seems more logical to do things like this:

        >>> m.set_mezzanine_power(True)

    The TuberCategory decorator allows this kind of call. Borrowing from
    FMCMezzanine again, we invoke the TuberCategory decorator as follows:

        @tuber.TuberCategory("Mezzanine", lambda m: m.iceboard,
            {"mezzanine": lambda m: m.mezz_number })
        class FMCMezzanine(HWMResource):
            [...]

    The decorator intercepts Tuber functions that claim to be members
    of the "Mezzanine" category, and using the FMCMezzanine object's
    mezz_number property, fills in "mezzanine" parameters before
    dispatching the function call back to the mezzanine's "iceboard"
    property.

    "Categories" are exported by C code. For example, try the following:

        $ curl -d '{"object":"IceBoard","property":"set_mezzanine_power"}' \
                http://iceboard004.local/tuber|json_pp
