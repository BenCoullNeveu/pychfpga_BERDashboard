class IceBoard(Motherboard, TuberIceBoardBase):  # Motherboard has to be first otherwise undefined attributes try to access Tuber
    """ Provide the methods needed to operate the Iceboard hardware and its FPGA firmware.

    The superclasses provides the following functionalities:

    - Motherboard: Generic motherboard definition with hardware map management
    - TuberIceBoardBase: provides access and allow to execute ARM method running
      on the IceBoard's ARM processor as if they were local methods. This is
      done over the `Tuber` protocol which provide access to the ARM
      processor and the API provided by it to control and monitor the board's
      hardware. `IceBoardHandler` also inherits from `Handler`, which allows
      an `chFPGA_controller` instance to attach itself to a (volatile)
      hardware map object and draw some of its parameters from it.

    This class adds:
        - Model, serial, slot, crate and mezzanine self discovery using Tuber
        - Tuber-specific method to configure the FPGA
        - Access to the core memory-mapped registers in the FPGA's firmware using the ARM-FPGA SPI link. The core registers are used to check the firmware CRC,  setup FPGA networking, and provide access to the IRIG-B module.
            (see `fpga_core_reg_read/write_async()` methods.
        - Alternate access to the board peripheral through the FPGAs I2C interface (if present in the FPGA firmware), including:
            - LED control
            - GPIO input/output
            - Temperature sensors
            - Power monitoring for every rail (voltage,current)
            - Motherboard EEPROM
        - Any method provided by the FPGA firmware through the FPGAFirmware subclass that is set in self.fpga when the FPGA is configured through `set_fpga_bitstream_async()`.

        Parameters:

            hostname (str): passed to Tuber. If `hostname` is None, methods

                used on this instance. If `hostname` is 'None' but the

                potentially be resolved using mDNS discovery.

            serial (str or int): Serial number of the board, in the exact
                fromat it is found on the IPMI info of the board. For
                convenience, if `serial` is an integer, it is converted into a
                properly formatted string serial.

            slot (int): slot number on a crate, or virtual slot number for
                crate-less standalone boards. Ranges from 1 to NUMBER_OF_SLOTS
                in the particular icecrate. A value of  0 or None (i.e.
                bool(slot) == False)  indicates that there is no slot
                information.

            subarray: Arbitrary value that is used to group boards in logical
                categories.

        __init__() only sets the IceBoard key parameters and manages the

        IceBoardPlus

        Extends the basic IceBoard class by providing additional SPI MMI -based firmware features, direct UDP MMI
        with the FPGA,  and methods to access to IceBoard hardware directly via the FPGA.

        This class provides:

        - UDP/IP/Ethernet-based direct Memory Map Interface (MMI) to the FPGA using its Ethernet port. Note
          that this accesses an address space that is separate from the one accessed throughthe ARM SPI interface.
          Methods to initialize the Ethernt networking parameters through the ARM SPI interface are provided.

        - Alternate access to the IceBoard and Backplane hardware through the FPGA I2C interface through
          the `hw` object. Access to the hardware is normally done through the high-level ARM-provided
          methods, but these methods are useful for development and debugging. The exception is the the
          IceCrate handler which uses the FPGA to access backplane resources.

        - Overriden mezzanine identification methods that support non-IPMI McGill ADC mezzanine boards.

        - IRIG-B subsystem operation (through the ARM SPI interface)

        `IceBoardExtHandler` can be created as a standard Python object
        initialized with a number of parameters which set corresponding attributes
        (see below). If a `parent_getter` function is provided, the value of some
        of these attributes will instead be fetched dynamically from the parent
        object unless explicit values (i.e. not None) are provided here. An
        explicittly provided parameter will always use the provided value and will
        no longer be fetched from the parent, nor will it be set on the parent.


        Parameters:

            parent_getter (func): Function that dynamically return the parent object from which the
                following parameters will be fetched. Is `None` if there is no parent.

            hostname (str): hostname or IP address of the ICEBoard ARM processor (mandatory)

            serial (str): Serial number of the board. Can be provided by the ARM.

            part_number (str): Part number of the IceBoard. Can be obtained from the ARM.

            crate (IceCrateHandler): = object that handle the backplane on which the board is connected.
                `None` if the board is not connected to a backplane.

            slot (int): Slot number in which the board is installed ona backplane. None if there is no
                backplane.

            mezzanine (dict): Map {mezzanine_number: Mezzanine Handler, ...} describing the installed
                mezzanines. Can be obtained from the ARM.

            tuber_objname (str): name of the set of software functions that will be provided by the ARM
                processor through the Tuber interface.



        Python-based application-specific FPGA firmware and hardware handler are meant to be derived
        from this class.
