'''
Double-entry style asynchronous coding.

The following example coroutine sleeps asynchronously, then returns double its
argument:

    >>> @tworoutine
    ... async def double_slowly(x):
    ...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
    ...     return 2*x

Unlike traditional coroutines, we can call tworoutines synchronously:

    >>> double_slowly(2)
    4

(This is cheating, and intended only as a shortcut! You *cannot* use the
synchronous invocation from within an asynchronous event loop, since event
loops cannot nest.)

We can also, using a little sugar, call it asynchronously:

    >>> c = (~double_slowly)(2)
    >>> print(c) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <coroutine object double_slowly at 0x...>
    >>> asyncio.run(c)
    4

or

    >>> asyncio.run(double_slowly.__acall__(2))

...which devolves to the usual asyncio case.

Tworoutines can also be used as class methods:

    >>> class Foo:
    ...     @tworoutine
    ...     async def multiply_slowly(self, a, b):
    ...         await asyncio.sleep(1)
    ...         return a * b
    >>> f = Foo()
    >>> f.multiply_slowly(3, 4)
    12
    >>> c = (~f.multiply_slowly)(4, 4)
    >>> asyncio.run(c)
    16

We can also implement these things via inheritance:

    >>> class TripleSlowly(tworoutine):
    ...     async def __acall__(self, x):
    ...         await asyncio.sleep(1)
    ...         return 3*x

This works the same way:

    >>> ts = TripleSlowly()
    >>> ts(2)
    6
    >>> c = (~ts)(3)
    >>> print(c) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <coroutine object TripleSlowly.__acall__ at 0x...>
    >>> asyncio.run(c)

class tworoutine:
    '''
    Base class for double-entry style asynchronous coding.

    Wraps a coroutine (async function) so it can be invoked as a synchronous function.

    For client code, this class provides two points of entry:

    - tworoutine(args) Synchronous, via tworoutine(args), and
    - Asynchronous, via ~(tworoutine)(args).

    The synchronous entry is


    The object that is created here takes the place of the function or method that it decorates.

    If we decorate a class method, this object lives as a class attribute, and
    is passed the unbound method. The class can act as a non-data description.
    Any access to this object calls __get__, which returns another
    `twofunction` object that now points to the bound method.
