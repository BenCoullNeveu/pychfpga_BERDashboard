BER Dashboard
=============

To install and launch the BER dashboard command:

1. From the repository root, make the launcher executable:

```bash
chmod +x ber_dashboard
```

2. Run the installer once from the repository root:

```bash
./ber_dashboard
```

This adds ``ber_dashboard`` to ``~/.local/bin`` and uses the workspace ``.venv`` automatically.
After that, you can start the GUI from any working directory by typing:

```bash
ber_dashboard
```

Introduction
============

The ``pychfpga`` package is a Python framework for operating arrays of FPGA boards used in implementing radiotelescope arrays or various sizes, from a single-board desktop correlator up to arrays of hundreds of crate-mounted boards forming a multi-thousand element interferometers.

`pychfpga` can operate platforms that run the chfpga firmware (https://winterlandcosmology.bitbucket.io/chfpga/). Currently supported platforms are:

- Xilinx KC705: (FPGA: Kintex 7).  Off-the-shelf evaluation board. Needs one or two McGill MGADC08 8-channel ADC boards.
- Xilinx ZU111 (FPGA: Ultrascale+ RfSoC). Off-the-shelf evaluation board. Needs ADC breakout board.
- McGill IceBoard: (FPGA Xilinx Kintex 7). Custom board designed by McGill University to build for large synchronized arrays. Needs one or two McGill MGADC08 8-channel ADC boards.
- t0 CRS (Ultrascale+ RfSoC). Also a custom board designed by ``t0 technology`` (https://www.t0.technology) to build large synchronized arrays.

``pychfpga`` uploads the chfpga firmware to the FPGA and initializes all of its subsystems, including:

- ADC data acquisition (including calibration)
- F-Engine (channelizer) including a function generator, PFB/FFT, Scaler and raw data capture
- Corner-turn engine for trasposing data between 1 board, 1 crate (16 boards) or 2 crates (32 boards)
- Optional on-board X-Engine (N^2 correlator): (4 + 4j) bit data width
- Optional 40- or 100 Gbps Ethernet real-time data offload to an external X-Engine farm.

`pychfpga` is currently used to operate telescopes such as CHIME, CHORD, HIRAX, various outriggers of the previous telescopes, and a number of small portable interferometer-based experiments.


Features
========

- Multi-platform: Supports multiple hardware platforms

- Hardware map manager: Keeps track of all the boards, crates and mezzanine boards in an arra and
  how they connect together.

- Auto-discovery: FPGA boards can be added to the hardware map explicitely by specifying their IP
  address, or can be automatically found on local network using mDNS based on the board or crate
  serial numbers. The boards can query the hardware to find the model and serial number of the
  motherboard, crate and mezzanines..

- Concurrent operation: The array manager can perform operations on mutiple boards at the same time
  using asynchronous coroutine to maximize performance.

- Array-wide synchronization: Provides method to perform array-wide data acquisition synchronizaiton
  based on GPS-provided timestamps

- Multiple operational modes: The FPGA can be configured in various ways (correlator, baseband streaming etc.).
  The proper FPGA firmware for the desired operational mode and platform is automatically selected,
  uploaded to the FPGA, and initialized.

``pychfpga`` can be used both in interactive or automated modes:

- Interactive mode : In interactive mode, the user instantiates the :class:`fpga_array.FPGAArray`
  with parameters that indicates the hardware map, operational mode etc. The user can then use the
  resulting object to  interact with the array or individual boards, and perform on-the-ply data
  acquisition and processing. This is typically used in ``ipython`` or a Jupyter Notebook.

- Automated mode: in automated mode, the :class:`fpga_master` module automatically identifies and initializes the array based on a YAML configuration file, and provides a Web server that:

		# continuously publish system metrics (temperatures, voltages, data overflows etc) that can be scraped by data logging software like Prometheus
		# Provide a REST command interface that allows a client to start or stop operation of the array and perform a number of on-the-fly data gathering and operational changes.
- Can be operated as a Docker container

Requirements
============


Repository Access
-----------------

``pychfpga`` and many of its dependencies are hosted in a private git repository on ``bitbucket``.

Before you start, you therefore need:

- A bitbucket (free) account (https://bitbucket.org)
- A ssh private/public key pair, with the public key attached to your bitbucket account
- Permissions to the pychfpga and dependencies repositories. Ask McGill administrator.

SSH keys
--------

In order to be able to pull the package and its dependencies from bitbucket, you need setup your command shell such that ``git`` can  provide the proper ``ssh`` key to the repository servers. One way to do this is to load your private key into your local ssh agent::

	    eval `ssh-agent -s`
	    ssh-add path_to_bitbucket_key

You can also use key forwarding or make specific ``ssh`` config entries for bitbucket.


System requirements
-------------------

- The following programs should be installed
	- git LFS (git >1.8.2 includes LFS by default.)
	- Python 3.8 There are issues with Python 3.10, and QC tests have issues with 3.9
	- pip >=18.1  (2018-10-05) or later (to support the PEP 508 dependency specs)
	- python3.8-dev (required for netiface to be compiled by pip)

	sudo apt install  pythonX.X-dev  # on Ubuntu

- Install Prometheus and Grafana if you want to view the system status graphs published by `fpga_master`. The appropriate Prometheus config file and grafana panels need to be installed.


- If you expect to receive raw ADC, FFT or correlator packets from the IceBoard (using `raw_acq.py`, for example), you need to enable jumbo frames and increase buffer size. The following commands do that for the current session. You might want to make those changes permanent (not shown here)::

	sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000 # replace "eth0" with your interface name
   sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=26214400
   sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=26214400


FPGA hardware requirements
--------------------------

To operate a board, You also need the following:

- One or multiple Iceboards, in a crate or on the benchtop
- A generic IceBoard SD card installed in each board (the card contains the ARM linux system). The SD card image that works with the current release is in ``./pychfpga/arm_firmware``.
- A SFP+ to RJ45 adapter connected in the SFP+ cage of each IceBoard
- Power supply to power the board(s) or crate(s)
- Proper cooling (fans) on the FPGA and some airflow over the ADCs mezzanines
- A 1G Ethernet switch or router (NOT a 10/100 device!) to which the IceBboard will be connected, and which connects directly or routes to your control computer
- Two Ethernet cables per IceBoard to connect the FPGA and ARM to the switch
- A control computer (Windows or Linux, Mac not tested) connected on the same subnet as the IceBoard(s)
- All the switches/router between the IceBoard(s) and control computer must have Jumbo frame enabled if you are expecting to gather raw ADC, FFT or correlator data over the 1G Ethernet link (ot the QSFP+).
- The computer firewall must allow the UDP packets from the FPGA to be accepted
- The IceBoard/computer subnet shall have:

   - A net mask of at least 255.255.252.0 (/22) or larger (e.g. 255.255.0.0) to include the FPGA addresses of *.*.3.*.
   - A DHCP server configured to provide IP addresses that are not in the range *.*.3.* (e.g DHCP provides addresses in 192.168.0.*).

- If multiple boards are to be used in a synchronized fashion, an external 10 MHz clock and IRIG-B source (often from a GPS receiver) must be fed to each board via SMA connectors or through the crate's backplane.




Configuring the hardware
------------------------

- Install the SD card in the ICE Board
- Set-up the appropriate reference clock source (jumper)
- If required, connect the clock and IRIG-B. WATCH OUT FOR THE LEVELS OF ANY EXTERNAL SIGNALS.
- Connect the power supply
- Power up the board. The 2 PLL LEDs at the bottom of the front panel shall turn on immediately to indicate there is a clock. After about 25 seconds, the upper leds will blink then stay on to show that the ARM has acquired an IP address and had finished booting.


Two Ethernet cables need to be connected between the IceBoard and the 1G Ethernet switch or router that connects to your control PC:

   - One cable connects to the ARM Ethernet port on the dual RJ-45 connectors. That port works at any speed.
   - One cable connects to the FPGA Ethernet port through the SFP+ cage using a SFP-to-RJ45 1G Adapter.  That port operates supports **only** 1G Ethernet.




Installation
============

Get the ``pychfpga`` repository::

	$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:winterlandcosmology/pychfpga.git  # add the ``-b`` option to specify a branch

Create a clean python environment and install the `pychfpga` package all its dependencies::

	$ python3 -m venv my_env  # create new virtual environment named "my_env". You can clear an existing environment with "virtualenv --clear my_env"
	$ source my_env/bin/activate  # activate the new environment
	$ pip install -e ./pychfpga  # install in-place

If you plan manual interactive sessions (which is useful for debugging first installations), install ipython::

	$ pip install ipython

If you want to operate the Quality Control (QC) test scripts, you can ask for the additional dependencies to be installed with::

	$ pip install -e ./pychfpga[qc]  # install in-place with the QC dependencies









Manual operation (using :mod:`fpga_array`)
==========================================

`fpga_array` creates an object that represents any number of ICEBoards and ICECrates and allows their initialization. Once started, it returns control to you. (See `fpga_master` for a full stand-alone automated server).

Manual operations are done through ipython. First start ipython in the proper folder and python environment::

	source my_env/bin/activate  # activate the python environment
	cd pychfpga
	ipython

Power-up the boards. We are now ready to initialize your board(s). Here are a few specific examples depending on your setup (from a single board to a full 128-board array)

Assuming you have a single IceBoard with IP address 1.2.3.4 and want to use an external correlator that will process the data from the two QSFP+ links (mode `shuffle16`)::


	run -i fpga_array 1.2.3.4 --prog --open --sync_method local_soft_trigger --mode shuffle16

If you have avahi/bonjour server (a MDNS server) running on your computer, you can specify the board through its model and serial number, and the MDNS protocol will resolve the IP address of the board. In the following example, we start the IceBoard MGK7MB serial 0123 with the stand-alone firmware correlator (mode `corr16`) that will stream integrated data over the 1G Ethernet SFP+ link::

	run -i fpga_array mb 123 --prog --open --sync_method local_soft_trigger --mode corr16

With avahi/bonjour present, you can also select an ensemble of boards by crate model and serial number. Here we select all boards on . Here we intialize 2 crates that are based on the 16-slot backplane model MGK7BP16, and with the serial numbers 12 and 13. These crates will be given the crate number 0 and 1, respectively. We have 512 analog inputs we pass through the FPGA's corner-turn engine and send to an external correlator farm (mode shuffle512). All the boards in the arrayare synchronized together through IRIG-B:

	run -i fpga_array bp16 12:0 13:1 --prog --open --sync_method distributed_time --mode shuffle512


Server-based operation
======================

`fpga_master` is a stand-alone server that initializes and operates the IceBoards based on a configuration file, and provides a web server that can receive REST commands over HTTP and can publish monitoring metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus and displayed by Grafana (all free programs).

`raw_acq` is another stand-alone server that is run in parallel with `fpga_master` to receive, analyze and store the raw ADC, FFT or *firmware* correlator data that is captured periodically and sent by the IceBoards over the FPGA SFP+ 1G Ethernet link. This server does *not* process the real-time post-corner-turn-but-not-correlated data coming out of the IceBoard's QSFP+ links; those are meant to go directly to high-performance correlator nodes.


You need a YAML configuration file that instructs fpga_master what board(s) to include and how to set them up.

Operation
---------

First, make sure you are in the pychfpga folder and in the right python environment::

	source my_env/bin/activate  # activate the python environment
	cd pychfpga

`raw_acq` starts a web server can receive raw data  from the ICeBoards (ADC, FFT, firmware correlator) and store those to disk, and also publishes metrics for Prometheus. To start the raw_acq server::

	./raw_acq.py

where `jfc.drao` is the section in the configuration file that contains a raw_acq definition.

To start the fpga_master server::

	./fpga_master.py path_to_config_file:jfc.drao

Docker operation
================


pychfpga is also available as a docker image, with all system and Python dependencies already installed.


Build:

export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain
docker build --no-cache -t pychfpga:jfc_dev .

Building the Docker Image
-------------------------

In order to build the docker image for `pychfpga` you need to have access to ssh-identity with read permissions to this and other `wtl` repositories.

- Environemt Parameter DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 is required to be set, before the build.
- In order to build the image execute the following command if the correct ssh-identity is already loaded into the `ssh-agent`
	$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t chimefrb/pychfpga:latest --ssh github_ssh_key=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK .
- Alternatively, if you have the private key, you can use:
        $ docker build -f Dockerfile -t chimefrb/pychfpga:latest --ssh github_ssh_key=/path/to/id_rsa .
