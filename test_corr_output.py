top_test.py script 
 Instantiates a chFPGA object 'c' for interactive testing. Import in ipython using "r -i top_test" so the created chFPGA object "c" is accessible in the ipython interactive workspace.

History:
    2011-08-14 JFC: Created from chFPGA, which now only contains top test code.
    2011-09-09 JFC: Added global FREF 
    2011-10-11 JFC: Updated delay tables
