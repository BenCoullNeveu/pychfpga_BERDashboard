'''
YAML session loader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this code, we can create a hardware map and associated data. If
'session.yaml' is a file containing the following::

    # Hardware Map
    ---

    validity: [ !!timestamp "2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00", ~ ]

    # Create a hardware map with the following contents
    hardware_map: !HardwareMap

        # SQUID controllers
        - &mgngsq4-06-01 !SQUIDController { serial: 06-01 }

        # Mezzanines
        - &fmc2_001 !MGMEZZ04
            serial: FMC2_001
            squid_controller: *mgngsq4-06-01

        # Dfmuxes
        - !Dfmux
            hostname: iceboard004.local
            mezzanines: [ ~, *fmc2_001 ]

...then a session (containing a hardware map) can be instantiated as follows::

    >>> from pydfmux.core import session, dfmux

    >>> s = session.load(file('session.yaml'))
    >>> hwm = s['hardware_map']

    >>> print hwm.query(dfmux.Dfmux).one()
        Dfmux(u'iceboard004.local')

The yaml module also permits parsing a string; extensions in this file permit
loading data from external JSON or YAML files.
